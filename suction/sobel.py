"""Sobel suction quality scoring.

Computes surface normals from the spatial gradient of the organised point
cloud image (treating XYZ channels as a 3-channel image and applying Sobel
derivative filters to obtain tangent vectors, then crossing them).
Flatness is measured the same way as the KNN method — local std of normals
in a pixel-space window.  Final score: flatness x approach_alignment.
